# Predictive Analytics of Credit Writing

## Company Background 
CredPal, headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, pioneers point-of-sale credit solutions, enhancing consumer credit accessibility and retail sales growth. Through innovative credit infrastructure, CredPal simplifies credit purchases for consumers and enables on-demand credit for retailers. With an impressive track record, CredPal drives an average 23% sales increase for partner merchants. Notably, since its inception, CredPal has catalyzed significant growth, with large enterprises witnessing up to 16% expansion and small businesses experiencing up to 200% surge. Positioned at the forefront of fintech innovation, CredPal exemplifies the transformative power of technology in reshaping financial landscapes and fostering economic prosperity.

## Project Statement
This project revolves around leveraging predictive analytics to understand consumer spending habits and savings capabilities, particularly focusing on the scalability potential of CredPal's credit solutions across various regions and income groups. Sponsored by Stripe, a software technology company based in San Francisco, the project aims to provide actionable insights to guide investment decisions.

## Business Task
The primary objective is to analyze consumer spending data to validate the scalability of CredPal's credit infrastructure. This involves understanding how consumer spending patterns vary across regions and income levels, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating that CredPal's solution can effectively drive retail sales growth for merchants.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises anonymized consumer spending and income data collected from different regions and income groups. It includes variables such as income size, expenditure categories, and regional demographics. The dataset serves as the foundation for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

## Methodology
In this project analysis, we  employ Python for EDA and predictive modeling, supplemented by visualization tools such as PowerBI, Tableau, and Google Data Studio for data exploration and presentation. my team collaborates to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, focusing on identifying consistent spending trends and savings capabilities across diverse demographics.

## Prediction
The successful scalability of CredPal's solution hinges on the correlation between higher disposable incomes, greater saving potential, and increased investment opportunities. As disposable incomes rise, so does the capacity to save, ultimately expanding the credit market for CredPal. Anticipating a boost in disposable income in the upcoming year (2018), provided that the crisis leading to a sharp decline in disposable income in 2017 does not recur, further reinforces the potential for CredPal's growth.

## Conclusion
This predictive analytics model not only aids Stripe's investment choices concerning CredPal but also benefits other firms aiming to comprehend consumer behavior and anticipate market trends. By scrutinizing spending patterns and savings potentials, businesses can fine-tune strategies to effectively target specific demographics, fostering growth and profitability. Hence, this model serves as a crucial asset for making well-informed decisions in the ever-evolving realm of consumer finance and retail.
